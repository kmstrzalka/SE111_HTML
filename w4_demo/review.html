            <h2> Review of the movie <em> Beetlejuice</em>(1988)</h2>

            <p>&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;</p>

            <p>one of if not my most favorite moive from the late 80's, a must watch if you haven't. For being the 1990 winner of the Saturn Award, this movie went though alot of changes and almost wasn't called beetlejuice but "Scared Sheetless".</p>

                <h3>Trivia about <em>movie title</em></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>trivia #1 Tim Burton feared the "Day-O" sequence wouldn't go over well, since in his opinion it wasn't very funny. He turned out to be wrong: audiences loved it and think of it as one of the film's most iconic scenes.</li>
                   <li>trivia #2 The film was the first DVD sent out by Netflix in 1998.</li>
                   <li>trivia #3 The studio originally wanted to call the film "House Ghosts." As a joke, Tim Burton suggested the name "Scared Sheetless" and was horrified when the studio actually considered using it.</li>
